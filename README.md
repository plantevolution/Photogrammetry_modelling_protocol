# Flower photogrammetry and 3D modeling protocol

This protocol is an evolving protocol used in the Joly lab at the Université de Montréal (Canada)

This protocol describes how to obtain three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of flowers using photogrammery. It
describes in details the set-up, settings and steps that has worked for us for building accurate flower
models, but other approaches are certainly possible. Hence, we hope this protocol serves as a starting point rather than
a final protocol. We welcome any comments.

The manuscript describing this protocol in presently in revision. Please come back for a final citation!
